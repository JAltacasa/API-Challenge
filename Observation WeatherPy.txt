Observations WeatherPy
    1. The closer the latitute is to zero, the temperature goes higher. This observation is reenforced by the fact that the r-squared values, for both the correlation
       Temp vs Positive latitute and Temp vs Negative Latitute are about .6, which is very high.
    
    2. Cloudiness is not affected significantly by latitute. However, these does seem to be an indication that cloudiness is more affected by an increase from latitute 0 to 
       a negative latitude. This is shown by a slight higher r-squared value for this correlation.

    3. Humidity and latitude also seem to have little correlation. Though the correlation is more pronounced from latitude 0 to positive given a higher r-squared value. There are a lot of cities in the 
       data sample located in very northern locations and with significant humidity.
